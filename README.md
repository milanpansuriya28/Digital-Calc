# Digital-Calc
<br><strong> This is my first project.</strong>

## Overview

This project consists of a simple console-based digital calculator implemented in C++. The calculator includes three main functionalities:

1. **Basic Calculator**: Performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Scientific Calculator**: Provides advanced mathematical functions such as squaring, cubing, exponentiation, and powers of 2.
3. **Trigonometry Calculator**: Calculates trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, tangent, and their reciprocals (cosecant, secant, cotangent).

## Features

- **Basic Calculator**:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Exit the calculator (`1`)

- **Scientific Calculator**:
  - Square (`x^2`)
  - Cube (`x^3`)
  - Exponentiation (`x^n`)
  - Powers of 2 (`2^n`)
  - Exit the calculator (`0`)

- **Trigonometry Calculator**:
  - Sine (`sin`)
  - Cosine (`cos`)
  - Tangent (`tan`)
  - Cosecant (`cosec` or `1/sin`)
  - Secant (`sec` or `1/cos`)
  - Cotangent (`cot` or `1/tan`)
  - Exit the calculator (`0`)
