# Digital-Calc 
<br><strong> This is my first project.</strong>

## Overview

This project consists of a simple console-based digital calculator implemented in C++. The calculator includes two main functionalities:

1. **Basic Calculator**: Performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Scientific Calculator**: Provides advanced mathematical functions such as squaring, cubing, exponentiation, and powers of 2.

## Features

- **Basic Calculator**:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Exit the calculator (`1`)

- **Scientific Calculator**:
  - Square (`x^2`)
  - Cube (`x^3`)
  - Exponentiation (`x^n`)
  - Powers of 2 (`2^n`)
  - Exit the calculator (`0`)
